#Program that figures out if a given number of chicken McNuggets can be bought without leftovers given 
#6, 9, and 20 piece boxes. This was a response to MIT 6.00 problem set 2 (3rd of the course). I'm pretty proud of this code,
#figured it out all on my own. At one point it was 50+ lines, needing much more, with 3 functions and a program body that 
#looped back into one of the functions. Took 4-5 hours, but the best spent time was just thinking it through, finally realizing
#how I could do the three "for" loops nested inside each other. Now seeing it as 11 lines of code (not including the spaces)
#it just strikes me as a thing of beauty.

#Reduced the range numbers to save computing time once I realized that 43 was the most that couldn't be bought without
#leftovers.
#At one point had candidate defined as a global variable, then realized I didn't need to change it in the test function. 
#Saved me two lines of code!

#Assuming that the larger boxes are the best deal, I could determine how to get the answer with the fewest boxes by inverting
#the "a" and "c" loops.
#But right now I'm just happy.
